# Iridescence

Welcome to Iridescence a new preset designed to give raytracing a much needed style overhaul! Iridescence features some nice changes to pre-existing features and one new feature not seen by any preset before! So lets explain why this preset is so special shall we?

# New Sky
* Iridescence features a custom sky model designed with style in mind rather than realism. Experience dramatic sunrises/sunsets, cool blue days, and cold nights. The classic BRTX sky is a physically based model, which uses accurate algorithms to calculate it, this new sky is much simpler, more reminiscent of that in VV as it is a gradient based model. Lots of time has gone into making this look perfect 

# Upgraded Fog Scattering
* With some research into how light scatters through fog and clouds, I've made a few tweaks to how fog is distributed into the scene. On the technical side of things, the fog now contains forward and backwards scattering lobes, allowing you to create hazy atmospheres, foggy atmospheres, whatever you want! Overall this change has made fog much more appealing to look at.

# Custom Tuned Lighting
* Lighting has seen some great adjustments overall. Shadow softness has been tweaked closer to that of vanilla raytracing, but using betterRTX tech to make them even better looking. Lighting is themed after the trailers and major inspiration from trailers and even the SDGP were used here when crafting this preset. This preset is designed for gameplay so nothing should ever be too dark and unplayable!

# Improved exposure response
* Auto exposure has been heavily fine tuned to make even the brightest of locations (looking at you deserts) wonderfully playable without your eyes being burned out. Everything should feel very well balanced and there should be very minimal auto exposure adjustments that would hinder or hurt your gameplay

# New Tonemap operator
* This preset runs on the Lottes tonemap operator, completely new to BetterRTX with Iridescence. Its a very well balanced tonemap that offers great colors and contrast while still being extremely playable!

# Denoising tweaks
* Denoising on reflections has seen a few tweaks. It is now less aggressive resulting in sharper more detailed reflections, as well as less ghosting and faster reprojection timings.

# Water and puddle changes
* Water and puddles have a new look. Both utilize a custom water wave system to simulate waves on oceans and small ripples in puddles
