<p className="lead">A completely new RTX sahder preset with pixelated lighting!</p>

Gilded Graphics is a completely new take on the style of BetterRTX, introducing comprehensive changes to the entire style.

Pixelated lighting will adapt to the resolution of any resource pack used, on any surface light touches!

Features:

- Pixelated shadows, reflections, and global illumination!
- Flashes of light in The End!
- Completely redone colour grading!
- All BetterRTX 1.4 features!
