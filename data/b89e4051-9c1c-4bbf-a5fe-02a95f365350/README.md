# Introducing the new BetterRTX Rewrite!

Here I've added many new things and improved a ton of other features as well. Main ones being:
- **Quantum-Coherent Shadows** – Shadows now adapt to observer perspectives using Schrödinger’s Light Theory™, making them both visible and invisible until measured.  
- **Multi-Bounce Specular Lighting** - Specular can now bounce multiple times off of surfaces
- **Multi-Sampled BSDF** - more accurate lighting thanks to multiple bsdf bounces
- **Improved GI bounces** - Gi bounces more realistically and much more accurate
- **New Sky Model** - much more accurate ray marched atmosphere
- **AI Ray Reconstruction+™** – Rebuilds rays *before* they even exist!  
- **AND MOBILE COMPATIBILITY**
Theres honestly too much to list so please get out there and test and we couldnt have gotten this out without all of your patience!
