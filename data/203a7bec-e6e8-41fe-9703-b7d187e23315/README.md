# Interstellar 

<p className="lead">Take to the skies and experience the atmospheres of different planets!</p>

Default: Mars
- Immersive Mars atmosphere derived from real images and studies!
- AgX Tonemapping
- Hardcoded Air fog designed specifically to feel like mars dust (resource pack fogs are incompatible)
- Adjusted fog distribution patterns to feel less like fog
- Improved weather effects
- Slow water waves
- Thick water absorption
- Tiny sun to represent how it might look from mars
- Super sharp shadows due to lack of atmosphere
