# BetterRTX Presets

## Generate a UUID

Each pack needs its own UUID. Easily [generate one online](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) or in VS Code by pressing `Shift+Alt+U`.

## Generate a Preset

Preset settings can be generated using the [BetterRTX Creator](https://bedrock.graphics/creator) tool. Download and test the `.rtpack` output to find your desired settings.

After modifying the settings, go to the _Setup_ tab and click the _Save File_ button. This will create a `settings.json` file to download.

### JSON Schema

The settings file can also be manually adjusted in a JSON file editor, such as VS Code. Use the following schema URL in the file to enable auto-completion:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://bedrock.graphics/creator/schema"
}
```

## Clone the Repository

Clone this repo to begin adding your preset.

Save the preset settings in `./presets/[Your UUID]/settings.json`

### Write a README

Add the file `./presets/[Your UUID]/README.md|mdx` to have a Markdown / MDX document loaded on the preset page.

#### Add Frontmatter to the README

Your README's Frontmatter serves as the single-source-of-truth for the preset throughout the website and API.

Example:

```yaml
---

installerTitle: "The Text Displayed in the Installer"
